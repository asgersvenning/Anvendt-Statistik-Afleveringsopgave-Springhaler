# Background 

Terrestrial arthropods’ ability to survive subzero winter temperatures is an important factor influencing their abundance and geographic distribution. It is, therefore, important to understand their physiological mechanisms of low-temperature survival. Acclimation to moderate–low temperature can improve cold tolerance, and pre-acclimation to mild desiccation can also improve survival of a subsequent cold exposure. 
In the present study, the authors combined cold acclimation with drought acclimation making it possible to assess the interactions between effects of these two stressors using the springtail Protaphorura fimata as a model organism. For more details and results in see [Holmstrup and Slotsbo (2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00360-017-1127-0).


</br>

# Purpose

In this exercise, you shall only model the effect of temperature and drought on osmolality, which is an important factor in the organisms ability to supercool and avoid damaging effects of freezing.

</br>

# Saturation model

In the analysis of the data you will be using an empirical saturation model,
$$y(t) = \frac{c_1 t}{c_2 + t}$$
where **t** is time, $c_1$ is the asymptotic value for **y** when $t \rightarrow \infty$, and $c_2$ is the half saturation point (the time when $y = c_1/2$).
In order to use the above saturation model in a GLM the model is inverse transformed, 
$$y(t)=\frac{c_1\ \ t}{c_2+\ t}\Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{y(t)} = \frac{c_2+\ t}{c_1 t}\Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{y(t)} = \frac{c_2}{c_1 t}+\frac{t}{c_1 t} \Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{y(t)} = \frac{c_2}{c_1}t^{-1}+c_1^{-1} $$


</br>

# Data 

In the Excel workbook “Data - springhaler” there are two datasets: 

1. Effect of drought and temp (Holmstrup and Slotsbo, 2018).
2. Osmolality with time (see Fig. 1 in Holmstrup and Slotsbo, 2018):

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="data.png"></p>


</br>

## Read data from files

```{r}
OsmoTime <- read_xlsx("Data/Data opg2 - springhaler.xlsx", 
                      sheet = "Osmolality with time") %>% 
  mutate_at(c("Temperature"),factor)

DroughtTemp <- read_xlsx("Data/Data opg2 - springhaler.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "Effect of drought and temp") %>% 
  mutate_at(c("Temperature","Treatment"),factor)
```

</br>

# Tasks




</br>

## Use the dataset "Effect of drought and temp". Is there an effect of temperature or/and drought on osmolality?

To investigate whether *drought* and/or *temperature* has an effect on *osmolality*, we will first visually investigate:
```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(DroughtTemp, aes(x = Temperature, y = Osmolality, fill = Treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:8/5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.95,0.5),
        legend.title = element_text(family = "Georgia",
                                  face = "bold",
                                  size = 14),
        legend.text = element_text(family = "Georgia",
                                  size = 12),
        legend.key.size = unit(c(10,10),"mm"),
        legend.background = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_text(family = "Georgia",
                                  face = "bold",
                                  size = 14),
        strip.text = element_text(family = "Georgia",
                                  face = "bold",
                                  size = 14))
```
From where a substantial difference in *osmolarity* between the *control* group and *drought* treated group is obvious. On the other hand the effect of *temperature* on *osmolarity* is not very clear, but since we are only conducting a visual analysis we must be careful to reach conclusions yet.

For this reason we will move on to investigating the effectsizes and significance-levels quantitatively using a linear model: 

```{r}
droughtLM <- lm(Osmolality ~ Temperature + Treatment, data = DroughtTemp)

droughtCoef <- droughtLM %>% 
  summary %$%
  coefficients

droughtCoef %>% 
  round(5) %>%  
  kable(caption = "<center><b><h3> Result of the linear model using the formula: <br> Osmolality ~ Temperature + Treatment",
        escape = F,
        align = "c") %>% 
  kable_classic(full_width = F,
              font_size = 20, html_font = "Cambria") %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>% 
  column_spec(5, background = if_else(droughtCoef[,4] < 0.05, "", "red", ""))
```

Which (unsurprisingly) confirms our suspicions from the visual analysis; the effect of *treatment* is large and statistically significant, while the effect of *temperature* is small and not statistically significant.
This concludes that the springtails' osmolality is effected by the drought but that the temperature does not have a significant effect on springtails' osmolality.


</br>

## Check the fit of the model used in task 1.

Next we check the fit of the model using R's inbuild diagnostic plots:
```{r, fig.height=5}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
droughtLM %>% 
  plot(1:2)
```
From this analysis we can observe from  _Residuals vs Fitted plot_ that the residuals are randomly distribtuted on either side of the residual trend line. Furthermore the _Normal Q-Q plot_ shows that the dataset is approximatly normal distrubuted. 

</br>

## Use the above saturation model and the dataset "Osmolality with time". Fit the best line to each of the four temperature.


Again we first investigate visually, then move on to the quantitative model:
```{r}
ggplot(OsmoTime, aes(x = Hours^-1, y = Osmolality^-1, color = Temperature)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = T) +
  facet_wrap(~paste0(Temperature, "\u00B0C")) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(family = "Georgia",
                                  face = "bold",
                                  size = 14),
        strip.text = element_text(family = "Georgia",
                                  face = "bold",
                                  size = 14))
```

From which we observe a clear positive correlation between reciprocal *osmolality* and *hours*, and maybe a lower slope for higher temperatures. However we must again move on to the quantitative analyses before we reach conclusions.

```{r}
osmoLM <- OsmoTime %>% 
  mutate_at("Temperature", factor) %>% 
  mutate(Osmolality = Osmolality^-1,
         Hours = Hours^-1) %>% 
  lm(Osmolality ~ Hours*Temperature, data = .)

osmoLM$coefficients %>% 
  as.matrix() %>% 
  kable(digits = 3,
        caption = "<center><b><h3> Linear model output: <br> Osmolality ~ Hours*Temperature",
        format = "html",
        align = "c") %>% 
  kable_classic(full_width = F, lightable_options = "striped",
              font_size = 20, html_font = "Cambria") %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>% 
  column_spec(2, width = "3cm")
```


</br>

## Use the above saturation model and the dataset "Osmolality with time". Is there an effect of temperature on the asymptotic osmolality?
<sub>*(hint: make one model with all the lines in task 3 and compare the use of both Type II and Type III tests)*</sub>

To answer the question of whether *temperature* has an effect on the asymptotic *osmolality*, we must first understand how to interpret the asymptotic *osmolality* from our model outputs. To understand this, we must first find an expression of the asymptotic *osmolality* from the original model:

$$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}{y(t)} =\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}{\frac{c_1 t}{c_2 + t}} = c_1$$
And find it in our linearized model:

$$y(t)^{-1} = \frac{c_2}{c_1}t^{-1}+c_1^{-1}$$
Therefore we can interpret the **intercept** in our linear model as the reciprocal asymptotic *osmolality*. Therefore to test for an effect of *temperature* on asymptotic *osmolality*, we can test the effect of *temperature* on the **intercept**. This can be inferred from the significance-levels of model parameters:

```{r}
osmoCoef <- osmoLM %>% 
  summary %$% 
  coefficients

osmoCoef %>%
  round(4) %>% 
  kable(caption = "<center><b><h3> Linear model summary: <br> Osmolality ~ Hours*Temperature",
        escape = F,
        align = "c") %>% 
  kable_classic(full_width = F, lightable_options = "striped",
                 font_size = 20, html_font = "Cambria") %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>% 
  column_spec(5, background =if_else(osmoCoef[,4] < 0.05, "", "red"))
```
Where we see only non-significant additive effects of *temperature*, which are exactly the effects on the **intercept**. This strongly implies that *temperature* has no effect on the asymptotic *osmolality*. 
We further investigate this by comparing the type II & III Anova *S*um of *S*quares:
```{r}
osmoAnova2 <- osmoLM %>% 
  Anova(type = "II")

osmoAnova2 %>% 
  kable(digits = 4,
        caption = "<center><b><h3> Anova - Type II <br> Osmolality ~ Hours*Temperature",
        align = "c") %>% 
  kable_classic(lightable_options = "striped",
              full_width = F,
              font_size = 20, html_font = "Cambria") %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>% 
  column_spec(5, background = if_else(osmoAnova2$`Pr(>F)` < 0.05, "", "red", ""))

osmoAnova3 <-osmoLM %>% 
  Anova(type = "III")

osmoAnova3 %>% 
  kable(digits = 4,
        caption = "<center><b><h3> Anova - Type III <br> Osmolality ~ Hours*Temperature",
        align = "c") %>% 
  kable_classic(lightable_options = "striped",
                 full_width = F,
                 font_size = 20, html_font = "Cambria") %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>% 
  column_spec(5, background = if_else(osmoAnova3$`Pr(>F)` < 0.05, "", "red", ""))
```
Where we see a drastic fall in Sum of Squares for *temperature* between type II & III, corresponding to inclusion of interaction terms in the model before calculating Sum of Squares in type-III. This is highly critical for the additive effect of *temperature*, and implies that instead *temperature* has an interactive effect with *hours*.
We thus find no significant effect of *temperature* on asymptotic *osmolality*.


</br>

## Use the above saturation model and the dataset "Osmolality with time". What is the estimated asymptotic osmolality at 15 degrees? 

Since we have estimated no significant effect of *temperature* on asymptotic *osmolality*, the estimated asymptotic *osmolality* can be calculated independently of temperature as simply:

$$c_1 = \hat{intercept}^{-1}$$
And we then find the estimated asymptotic osmolality as <b> `r osmoCoef["(Intercept)","Estimate"]^-1 %>% round(3)` </b>.


</br>

## Use the above saturation model and the dataset "Osmolality with time". Is there an effect of temperature on the time to reach the half saturation point?
<sub>*(I will call the time to reach the half saturation point)*</sub>

To investigative this we must, as when we investigated asymptotic *osmolality*, first investigate how to interpret the half saturation point from out model. Since we defined our first model:

$$y(t) = \frac{c_1 t}{c_2 + t}$$

In such as way that $c_2$ is exactly our half saturation point, it is quite easy to see from our linearized model:

$$y(t)^{-1} = \frac{c_2}{c_1}t^{-1}+c_1^{-1}$$
That we can find the half saturation point as $slope/intercept$. Since we found that there is no significant effect of *temperature* on intercept, but only an interactive effect (ie. effect on slope). We must conclude that *temperature* does have a significant effect on the half saturation point (i.e. time to reach half the asymptotic value).


</br>

## Use the above saturation model and the dataset "Osmolality with time". What is the estimated time to reach the half saturation point at 15 degrees?

We can now estimate our half saturation points from our model outputs:

```{r}
c_1I <- osmoCoef[1,"Estimate"]
c_1 <- c(c_1I^-1, ((osmoCoef[3:5,"Estimate"])+c_1I)^-1) %>% 
  unname

c_2H <- osmoCoef["Hours","Estimate"]
c_2 <- c(c_2H*c_1I^-1, (osmoCoef[6:8,"Estimate"] + c_2H)*c_1I^-1) %>% 
  unname

estimateKable <- tibble(Temperature = c(5,10,15,20), "asymptotic osmolality" = c_1, "half saturation time" = c_2) %>% round(4)

estimateKable %>% 
    kable(digits = 4,
        caption = "<center><b><h3> Estimates of asymtotic osmolality & half saturation time",
        align = "c",
        escape = F) %>% 
  kable_classic(lightable_options = "striped",
                 full_width = F,
                 font_size = 20, html_font = "Cambria") %>% 
  column_spec(1:3, background = if_else(1:4 == 3, "green", "", "")) 
```
And we thus find the estimated time to reach the half saturation point at 15 degrees as $\approx$ `r c_2[3] %>% round(3)` hours.


</br>

## Criticize the use of the above saturation model and check the fit of the model.

```{r,fig.height=5}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
osmoLM %>% 
  plot(1:2)

```


</br>

## Compare and discuss the results of tasks 1 and 4.
